# Serverless-Sample-example
Serverless Code Execution Project
Overview
This project showcases a serverless architecture using Kubernetes with OpenFaaS and Docker Desktop. It deploys two functions that handle code execution in different languages:

Python Code Executor: Takes Python code as input and returns the output of the executed code.
C Code Executor: Takes C code as input and returns the output of the compiled and executed code.
Prerequisites
Docker Desktop: Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.
Kubernetes: Have a Kubernetes cluster running locally via Docker Desktop.
OpenFaaS: Installed and configured on your Kubernetes cluster.
